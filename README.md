# reeslabree/counter-keeper

## summary
As a pet project for the start of 2023, I'd like to learn Rust + WASM, and Remix. Blackjack has always seemed to me to be the best way to prove your adequacy with a language, so I figured I'd start there. As of late, I've also been very interested in professional card counters on YouTube so I figured I'd merge my latest interests to create a new project.

## stages
I'll break this up into the a few stages of development, starting with some essentials to get my feet wet, and then some other features if I am enjoying this project and want to continue further.

### essentials
- [ ] implement a blackjack backed in rust
- [ ] compile and export typescript bindings
- [ ] remix frontend for blackjack game

### other features
- [ ] add support for 'keeping the count'
- [ ] adjust number of decks in the shoe
- [ ] score play based on basic strategy
- [ ] score play based on basic strategy + count
- [ ] additional bot players

### random thoughts
If this project is enjoyable enough, I'd like to implement other card countiung tools such as betting strategy builders & EV calculators.

It might also be neat to try adding additional players over the web.
