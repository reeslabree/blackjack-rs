# reeslabree/counter-keeper

## summary
As a pet project for the start of 2023, I'd like to learn Rust + WASM, and Remix. Blackjack has always seemed to me to be the best way to prove your adequacy with a language, so I figured I'd start there. As of late, I've also been very interested in professional card counters on YouTube so I figured I'd merge these interests to create a new project.

## stages
I'll break this up into the a few stages of development, starting with some essentials to get my feet wet, and then some other features if I am enjoying this project and want to continue further.

### essentials
- [ ] implement a blackjack backed in rust
- [ ] compile and export typescript bindings
- [ ] remix frontend for blackjack game

### other features
- [ ] add support for 'keeping the count'
- [ ] adjust number of decks in the shoe
- [ ] score play based on basic strategy
- [ ] score play based on basic strategy + count

### random thoughts
I'd like to implement other card countiung tools such as betting strategy builders & EV calculators.

It might also be interesting to build in crypto specific tools for this. I'm not aware of Solana casinos existing at the moment, and with crypto at an all time low it feels like we're all gambling anyways and might as well enjoy some games.
